<h1 class="display-4 mb-5">Our <span class="text-gradient yellow-orange">RIPE NCC</span> LIR services.</h1>

<p class="lead my-5">
    As a member of the RIPE NCC we're able to offer various LIR services to customers wishing to obtain Autonomous System Numbers or IP addresses.
    We'll work with you to give you the best shot at a sucessfull application to the RIPE NCC, and we'll help you get started with your new resources.
    For pricing information see <a href="/prices/">our pricing page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Autonomous System Numbers</h2>

<p>
  Autonomous System Numbers (or ASNs) are what identify different networks on the internet. Having one is essential to getting started with BGP.
  Getting an ASN from RIPE requires a LIR (Local Internet Registry, thats us!) to sponsor the application. 
  We'll guide you through the RIPE process and help you familiarise with the systems required to make effective use of your ASN.
</p>

<h3>Steps to getting your ASN</h3>

<ul class="list-group my-3">
  <li class="list-group-item bg-light">
    <h4 class="mb-1">Initial consultation</h4>
    <p>
      We'll discuss your needs and why you want an ASN, setup your objects in the RIPE database, and discover who you'll be peering with.
      If you need a 16-bit ASN for legacy hardware we'll collect the required documentation for that at this time.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item bg-light">
    <h4 class="mb-1">Contract preparation</h4>
    <p>
      Before we can submit the application to RIPE you'll have to sign an "Assignment Request and Maintenance Agreement" with us. This sets out
      our responsibilites as your LIR, and your responsibilites to us and to RIPE. We're also required to collect a form of identification,
      such as a formation document or trade register extract for body corporates; and a passport, driving license, or national ID card for individuals.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item bg-light">
    <h4 class="mb-1">Sign and pay</h4>
    <p>
      The contract will be sent via electronic means, no wasteful paper signatures here! We'll send an invoice for the application once the contract is
      signed and we're satisfied everything is read.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item bg-light">
    <h4 class="mb-1">Hand over to RIPE</h4>
    <p>
      We'll collate everything you've given to us and liase with the RIPE NCC to hand the application over to them. Once they have everything an ASN will <em>usually</em>
      be assigned within 2 days.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
  
<h2>PA and PI IP address blocks</h2>

<p>
  As a LIR we can also assign you IPv6 address blocks from our RIPE allocation as Provider-aggregatable address space, or sponsor Provider-independent address space (be it IPv4 or IPv6).
</p>

<h3>PA? PI? What's the difference</h3>

<p>
  In normal day to day operations there's not much different between them. The difference comes when you decide to change your LIR. PA space is tied to the LIR so you will have to renumber 
  when this happens, PI space is tied to yourself so it can be moved between LIRs. So why use PA at all? Simply; it is cheaper. RIPE charges each LIR an annual fee per PI block they
  sponsor, whereas PA space is included in the membership. For more a more detailed look at PI vs PA please refer to the RIPE policy on IP assignments;
