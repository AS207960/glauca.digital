        Hi! We're {{ site.title }}, pleased to meet you. We're on a mission to make our little corner of the
        web less less painful to use. We want to create a service that gets out of your way and lets you
        get on with what you wanted to do in the first place. We're trying to do that in a few ways:
    </p>

    <hr>

    <div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 600px;">
        <h2>Zero  <span class="text-gradient pink-red">fuss</span>.</h2>

        <p>
            Pricing is often complicated, befuddling, hazy etc. You get the point, it doesn't make sense. We'll tell you in
            simple terms what you'll be paying and when, without hiking prices on you purely for sticking with us.
        </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <div class="w-md-50 mx-auto" style="max-width: 600px;">
        <h2> <span class="text-gradient purple-pink">You</span> come first.</h2>

        <p>
            We want to build a platform that works for you, with features that are convenient for you to use. After all it's
            our job to do the hard work, so you don't have to.
        </p>

        <p>
            Want a feature we don't have yet? Just ask us, and if it makes sense we'll get our army of programmer sharks
            on it to make a reality. &#x1f988;
        </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <div class="w-md-50 mx-auto" style="max-width: 600px;">
        <h2>Top notch <span class="text-gradient teal-indigo">support</span>.</h2>

        <p>
            Stuff goes wrong, as much as we and you don't want it to, but it does. When the inevitable happens you can be
            sure we want it fixed as much as you do. When you contact us, a real human who understands your problem will be
            dealing with your query ASAP.
        </p>
